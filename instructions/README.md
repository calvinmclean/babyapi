# BabyAPI Instructions for LLMs/Agents

This directory contains detailed guides and documentation specifically designed to help Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI agents implement BabyAPI functionality effectively.

## Purpose

The files in this directory serve as comprehensive instruction manuals that AI agents can reference to understand:
- How to integrate various storage backends with BabyAPI
- Best practices for implementing specific features
- Architectural patterns and design principles
- Step-by-step implementation guides

## How LLMs/Agents Should Use These Instructions

When working with BabyAPI implementations, agents should reference these guides to ensure they follow established patterns and avoid common pitfalls.

### Accessing These Instructions

Agents can access these instruction files directly from the repository:

```bash
# Get the SQL storage integration guide
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/calvinmclean/babyapi/refs/heads/main/instructions/sql.md

# Get this README
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/calvinmclean/babyapi/refs/heads/main/instructions/README.md
```

### Usage Pattern

1. **Read the relevant guide** for the feature you're implementing
2. **Follow the step-by-step instructions** precisely
3. **Adapt code examples** to your specific project structure
4. **Reference architectural principles** to maintain clean code organization

## Why These Instructions Exist

Traditional documentation is often written for human developers who can:
- Fill in implementation gaps with experience
- Adapt examples to different contexts
- Understand implicit architectural assumptions

AI agents need more explicit, comprehensive guidance that:
- Provides complete, working examples
- Explains the "why" behind architectural decisions
- Covers edge cases and error scenarios
- Leaves no ambiguity in implementation steps
